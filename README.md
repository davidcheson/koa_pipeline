Repository for the development of a pipeline to calibrate and process data from the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA). WIP

Currently includes a script which can do rough calibration of data from the NIRC2 instrument on Keck II, given the user stores their data in a directory under which there are the subdirectories "sky", "science", and "flat", which contain the respective images associated with the one final calibrated image desired.
